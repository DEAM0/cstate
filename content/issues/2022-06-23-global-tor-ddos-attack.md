We are experiencing a network-wide DDoS attempt impacting the performance of the Tor network, which includes both onion services and non-onion services traffic. We are currently investigating potential mitigations.

Our hosting works, but because the whole network is DDOSED, some sites do not work. Please do not contact me, it is not my problem but TOR problem. Well thank you.
